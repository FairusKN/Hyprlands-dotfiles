## üé® Colors
All the colors are dynamically based on the current wallpaper! This is possible by using [pywal], a cli tool to generate colorschemes by using an image as a base.

## üñºÔ∏è Wallpapers
When you're at the [Installation] process, you can choose to copy my dotfiles' wallpapers folder. If you chose to copy, you can change the current wallpaper by pressing <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>, or clicking to change wallpaper in the Control Center.

## Installation
You'll need to have installed all needed packages before installing my dotfiles! Use your package manager to do so. See needed packages on [`Wiki/Dependencies`].

In order to install this style right away, just run this installation script:

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice: the installation script will make a backup folder containing all previous files in `~/hyprland-dots-bkp`.
