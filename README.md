## Installation
You'll need to have installed all needed packages before installing my dotfiles! Use your package manager to do so. See needed packages on [My wiki](https://github.com/FairusKN/Hyprlands-dotfiles/wiki).

In order to install this style right away, just run this installation script:

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Note the `$` character means that it's recommended to run this command without root privileges.

```nushell
 $ git clone "https://github.com/FairusKN/Hyprlands-dotfiles.git"; cd Hyprlands-dotfiles; bash apply.sh
```

## Origin Dotfiles
https://github.com/retrozinndev/Hyprland-Dots.git
